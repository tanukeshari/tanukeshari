Git is a version control system that developers use all over the world. It helps you track different versions of your code and collaborate with other developers. If you are working on a project over time, you may want to keep track of which changes were made, by whom, and when those changes were made



Git is a version control system that you download onto your computer. It is essential that you use Git if you want to collaborate with other developers on a coding project or work on your own project.

In order to check if you already have Git installed on your computer you can type the command git --version in the terminal.

If you already have Git installed then you will see what version you have. If you donâ€™t have Git installed you can visit the Git website and easily follow the download instructions to install the correct version for your operating system.



GitHub is a product that allows you to host your Git projects on a remote server somewhere (or in other words, in the cloud).

It's important to remember that GitHub is not Git. GitHub is just a hosting service. There are other companies who offer hosting services that do the same thing as GitHub, such as Bitbucket and GitLab.
